                <h3>Web Design</h3>
                <p><strong>Custom Website Design:</strong> Creating unique and tailored website layouts and designs based on a client’s needs, brand, and target audience.</p>

                <p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the website is mobile-friendly and displays correctly across various devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops, etc.).</p>
                
                <p><strong>User Interface (UI) Design:</strong> Crafting the visual elements that users interact with, such as buttons, navigation menus, and icons, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.</p>
                
                <p><strong>User Experience (UX) Design:</strong> Designing the overall experience for users, focusing on making the website intuitive, easy to navigate, and optimized for performance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Wireframing and Prototyping:</strong> Creating blueprints and mockups of the website’s structure and layout to visualize the user flow and gather client feedback before development begins.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Graphic Design:</strong> Designing visual elements like logos, banners, and other graphics that will appear on the website to align with the brand's identity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SEO-Friendly Design:</strong> Ensuring the website is optimized for search engines, making it easier to rank higher in search results and attract more visitors.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Content Management System (CMS) Integration:</strong> Implementing platforms like WordPress, Joomla, or custom-built systems that allow clients to manage their content without needing technical expertise.</p>
                
            <div class="service">
                <h3><strong>Debugging</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Identifying Errors:</strong> This involves understanding where and how an issue is occurring. Errors could arise from syntax mistakes, logical flaws, or external system dependencies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Analyzing Logs:</strong> Debugging often requires reviewing logs or console outputs to trace the source of the problem. These logs provide detailed information on the application’s behavior at runtime.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Isolating the Bug:</strong> Once an error is identified, debugging involves narrowing down the code to locate the specific part that causes the issue. This could be related to code logic, data handling, or third-party libraries.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Testing and Reproducing Errors:</strong> To effectively debug, it’s necessary to replicate the error. This may involve creating test cases or mimicking user actions to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Fixing Code:</strong> Once the bug is located, the next step is to modify the code, data structure, or configuration to fix the issue. After making changes, the code is tested again to ensure the fix works.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Optimizing Performance:</strong> Debugging isn’t just about fixing errors; it may also involve identifying performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, or inefficient processes that affect the overall speed and responsiveness of the system.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cross-Platform Debugging:</strong> Sometimes errors may arise only in specific browsers, devices, or operating systems. Debugging in such cases ensures the application performs well across all platforms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> After resolving an issue, debugging also involves testing to ensure that the fix doesn’t introduce new problems or break existing functionality (known as regression).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Collaborative Debugging:</strong> Developers may collaborate to resolve complex issues, sharing insights and techniques to address more challenging problems.</p>
